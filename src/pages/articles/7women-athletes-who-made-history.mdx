It is always a good moment to honor some women athletes who have inspired us in different sports disciplines.

It is not easy to select a few of them since the list of successful women in sports is extensive. However, we have made a selection based on the stories that have inspired us the most!

We all know that millions of women practice sports every day for diverse reasons, such as health, personal growth, feeling and looking better, or even lowering their stress levels. It is worth mentioning that all motivations for engaging in physical activity are valid. The Women Post will briefly mention the stories of some women that stand as symbols of women's achievements in various sports:

1 Simone Biles

Most of us have heard about this young athlete, who was only 19 years old in the
past Rio Olympic Games. She won 4 gold and one bronze medal in artistic gymnastics.
If this weren't impressive enough, various news channels confirmed that she had Attention

Born in 1961 in Romania, Nadia Comăneci was the first gymnast to obtain a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic event. Her coach Béla Károlyi discovered her when she was only six years old. During Comăneci's first international competition, in 1972, she won three gold medals. Later in 1975, she beat the 5-time European champion Ludmilla Tourischeva, winning four gold medals and one silver. In 1976 she became the first woman to perform a backward double jump.

5. Núria Picas

Born in Spain in 1976, Picas is a trail runner and sky runner. Shortly after running her first mountain marathon, in which she came third, she had an accident.

In 2012 she became champion of the Ultra-Trail World Championship.
